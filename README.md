# Simple-Chatty-Bot
Chat Box Program to demonstrate basic java syntax
This project demonstrates knowledge in string literals, conditional, for-loops, scanning input, printing data, and arithmetic operations. 
The program prompts the user to input data (strings, and integers) and responds appropriately. There are 6 methods that make up a complete
interaction: greet, remindName, guessAge, count, test, and end.
